                <p>
                    When you are given a parking ticket, the first reaction is normally panic. <br>
                    That’s a lot of money that most people just don’t have to fork up.<br>
                    Depending on the situation, you are most likely able to fight some sort of appeal. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2"> 1. Access The Situation</h4>
                <p> Before determining if you should make an appeal.<br>
                    First be honest with yourself and answer if this situation was your fault or not. <br>
                    If you were truly parked illegally, then making an appeal will only waste time in the end.<br>
                    But if you feel as if you were falsely given a parking ticket, then consider a letter of appeal.</p>
                    <br>
                
                <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3"> 2. Letter of Appeal</h4>
                <p>
                        A Letter of Appeal is sent to the court about the parking ticket. 
                        The letter should be <b>polite and honest</b>.<br> 
                        Do <b>not</b> try to make up parts of the story or skew parts to support your claims.<br>
                        You want to have the letter contain <b>clear facts</b> which you should hopefully have evidence to support, attached to the letter. <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>The letter should not insult the officer</b> that gave you the ticket. <br>
                        It should not make any suggestion that the officer was filling a quota, lying, or anything similar. <br>
                        Doing this could ultimately make whatever else you say become pointless to the clerk reading your letter of appeal.
                </p>
                For the letter you want to include the following things:
                <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Citation Number</li>

                    <li class="list-group-item">Evidence Support Your Appeal</li>
                </ol>

                        To whom it may concern,
                        <br><br>
                        I am writing to appeal ticket <i><b>number.</b></i>
                        I received this ticket on <i><b>date</b></i> at <i><b>time</b></i> at <i><b>location.</b></i><br>
                        The parking ticket was issued due to <i><b>"your violation description"</b>.</i> <br>
                        In this case I believe that <i><b> "your reasons as to why this law wasn’t violated or unknowingly. "</b></i><br>
                        I have enclosed further evidence to help support my argument to this letter. <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        If you have any questions, please contact me at phone number or email <br>
